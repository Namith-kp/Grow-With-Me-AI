# G Logo PNG Placeholder

This file indicates where the G logo PNG should be placed.

## Branding Update:
- The G logo represents the 'G' letter in "Grow With Me"
- Text now displays as "row With Me" (without the G)
- Logo and text work together as one integrated brand unit

## Instructions:
1. Replace this file with your G logo PNG
2. Name the file: g-logo.png
3. Ensure the PNG has a transparent background
4. Recommended size: 512x512 pixels or higher for crisp display
5. The logo will automatically appear in the application

## Current Implementation:
- The LogoIcon component is set up to use /g-logo.png
- Fallback SVG is provided if PNG is not found
- Logo is sized at 40x40px (h-10 w-10) in the header
- Hover effects and animations are included
- Text displays as "row With Me" next to the G logo

## File Location:
Place your g-logo.png file in the public/ folder (same directory as this file)
